                                <br>Each year, Earth Day—April 22—marks the anniversary of the birth of the modern 
                                environmental movement in 1970. Earth Day 1970 gave voice to an emerging consciousness, 
                                channeling the energy of the masses and putting environmental 
                                concerns on the front page.<br>
                                The students celebrate Earth Day with a medley of educational and fun activities. 
                                They are informed about the importance of Earth Day through various 
                                conservation-related activities performed and managed by the students themselves.
                                The week begins with badge and poster making. The following day, we make posters
                                showing how we can possibly save the Mother Earth. The students are told to 
                                write an appropriate verse on the occasion and then recite it for the class.

                                <br>Gold medals aren't really made of gold. They're made of sweat, determination, 
                                and a hard-to-find alloy called guts.<br>
                                The much awaited Annual Sports Day is held annually in the month of August
                                at <b>Trinity</b>. The fantastic turnout from the parents and the pleasant weather are 
                                the perfect boost for the students. The students enter into the spirit of the 
                                occasion in a grand way with the oath being administered by the special guest of the day. 
                                The Principal also takes the salute of the impressive March Past of the <b>Trinity</b> 
                                students. A peppy dance drill and an energizing exercise drill set the tone for the rest 
                                of the event. Once the races begin, the air is filled with cheering and tons of 
                                encouragement for the young athletes. Fun time with a shoe race and a tug-of-war 
                                between the teachers and parents adds to the enjoyment.

                                <br>An Inter-House Quiz competition is planned annually for the students. 
                                The Quiz begins with the introduction of the quizmaster and contestants from each house-team. 
                                The rules of the inter-house quiz competition are announced. The teams skilfully answer 
                                the questions asked. Though some of the questions are very tricky, the teams try to 
                                answer them with confidence. The questions put forth to the teams are intriguing, 
                                exciting and make the audience go ‘Aah!’ and clap when the teams answer correctly. 
                                Every round is a mixed bag with questions from history, sports, books, languages, 
                                vocabulary and science. The final round, the Rapid-fire round gives the teams a chance 
                                to catch up with leaders and put-up a tough fight. A range of emotions are felt – happiness, 
                                sadness, regret and excitement. In the and, everyone claps and cheers for the ecstatic 
                                winning teams.

                                <br>Teachers’ Day is celebrated on 5th September in school with great fervor. The Members 
                                of the Student Council, who have been preparing for the grand day for more than a week, 
                                organize a great show dedicated to their teachers. The day buzzes with excitement and 
                                smiles all around. It is fun and frolic starting with a humorous activity 
                                ‘Teach our Teachers’ which has the students in splits of laughter as teachers try to answer 
                                the ‘tough’ questions asked by the students. Music engulfs everyone with a graceful dance 
                                performance by the girls. Last but not the least, our boy band ‘Day Dream’ performs 
                                to entertain all. Of course, Teachers’ Day is never complete without the students 
                                mimicking their teachers. All the programs are enjoyed by the teachers.<br>
